# Predictive Thermal Control Spec

Status: draft
Owner: ThermalPilot
Date: 2026-06-27

## Purpose

ThermalPilot should evolve from a read-only thermal probe into a predictive,
inference-aware thermal assistant for Apple Silicon Macs.

The goal is not to replace Apple's thermal controller. The goal is to detect
that a sustained workload is likely to cause throttling and temporarily assist
cooling before the machine reaches a hot or throttled state.

The active-control path must remain opt-in, reversible, auditable, and model
allowlisted. Read-only mode remains the default.

## Prior Art Check

This section was revised after checking the MLX and Apple Silicon fan-control
ecosystem on 2026-06-27.

Important prior art exists:

- ThermalForge is an open source Apple Silicon fan-control app/CLI. It claims a
  Smart profile with rate-of-change awareness, proportional curves, watchdog
  recovery, CSV/JSON logging, process correlation, and proactive cooling before
  throttling.
- MTPLX is an MLX/MTP inference project that integrates fan control through
  ThermalForge or TG Pro. It has `default`, `smart`, and `max` fan modes.
  MTPLX Smart mode ramps fans while model requests are active and restores fans
  when the system goes idle. Its max path includes marker files, signal hooks,
  and a detached sidecar to restore fans if the parent process dies.
- The official `ml-explore/mlx`, `mlx-lm`, and `mlx-examples` repositories do
  not appear to contain fan-control or thermal-control code based on GitHub code
  search for `fan` and `thermal`.

ThermalPilot should therefore not position itself as "the first MLX fan-control
integration." That exists in MTPLX. ThermalPilot's useful open source wedge is
to be the auditable thermal substrate:

- model-specific SMC register discovery and capability files
- hardware evidence capture with raw bytes
- read-only telemetry and dry-run prediction
- explicit safety specifications and tests
- a small, reusable workload-intent API for any MLX or non-MLX runtime
- optional interop with ThermalForge rather than duplicating active control
  prematurely

## Product Gap

Many Mac fan tools provide reactive controls:

- fixed fan RPM
- sensor-based fan curves
- alerts
- manual boost modes
- menu-bar telemetry

Those tools are useful, but most general-purpose tools still respond to current
temperature or user-selected profiles. ThermalForge is the strongest exception:
it already claims proactive Smart behavior based on temperature velocity.

The remaining gap for ThermalPilot is not "fan curves." The gap is a
vendor-neutral, testable contract for workload-aware thermal decisions:

- Can a runtime tell the thermal system that a heavy workload is about to start?
- Can the thermal system explain, in dry-run mode, why it would pre-cool?
- Can decisions be reproduced from logged sensor windows and raw SMC evidence?
- Can multiple runtimes share one safe thermal advisor/controller?
- Can the active-control backend be swapped between ThermalForge, TG Pro, or a
  future native ThermalPilot helper?

ThermalPilot's differentiator is predictive pre-cooling:

1. Observe temperatures, fan RPM, power sensors, and thermal state.
2. Estimate short-horizon thermal risk.
3. Use workload intent, especially MLX inference intent, as an early signal.
4. Pre-cool upward for a bounded lease window, preferably through a verified
   backend such as ThermalForge before adding native writes.
5. Restore system control automatically.

## Current Implementation Boundary

The repository currently exposes read-only SMC operations only:

- `CSMCOpen`
- `CSMCClose`
- `CSMCReadKey`
- `CSMCReadKeyAtIndex`

There is no SMC write function in the current code. This must remain true for
the normal telemetry binary until an active-control helper is introduced behind
an explicit feature gate.

## SMC Model

Apple does not publish a stable public fan-control API for these keys. The SMC
surface used here is a private key/value interface exposed through IOKit user
clients named `AppleSMC` on older Macs and `AppleSMCKeysEndpoint` on this M4
Max machine.

ThermalPilot treats each SMC key as a four-byte register name. Examples:

- `FNum`: fan count
- `F0Ac`: fan 0 actual speed
- `F0Mn`: fan 0 minimum speed
- `F0Mx`: fan 0 maximum speed
- `F0Tg`: fan 0 target speed
- `F0Md`: fan 0 mode
- `TC*` / `TD*` / `TH*`: temperature-like keys
- `P*`: power-like keys

### IOKit Call Register Map

The current bridge uses `IOConnectCallStructMethod` with external method index
`2`. The input and output payloads use the AppleSMC-style `SMCKeyData` layout.

| Name | Value | Direction | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `KERNEL_INDEX_SMC` | `2` | method selector | IOKit external method used for AppleSMC commands. |
| `SMC_CMD_READ_BYTES` | `5` | `input.data8` | Read the bytes for `input.key` after key info has been read. |
| `SMC_CMD_WRITE_BYTES` | `6` | `input.data8` | Known legacy write command. Forbidden in the read-only binary. |
| `SMC_CMD_READ_INDEX` | `8` | `input.data8` | Read key name at `input.data32` index. |
| `SMC_CMD_READ_KEYINFO` | `9` | `input.data8` | Read size, type, and attributes for `input.key`. |
| `SMC_CMD_READ_PLIMIT` | `11` | `input.data8` | Known power-limit read command in legacy tooling. Not used today. |
| `SMC_CMD_READ_VERS` | `12` | `input.data8` | Known version read command in legacy tooling. Not used today. |

ThermalPilot may add read-only support for version and power-limit commands.
It must not add write support to the normal probe target.

### SMCKeyData Layout

The C bridge currently uses this layout:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | `uint32_t` | FourCC SMC key, big-endian textual form. |
| `version` | struct | SMC version data for version commands. |
| `pLimitData` | struct | Power-limit data for power-limit commands. |
| `keyInfo.dataSize` | `uint32_t` | Number of value bytes, capped to 32 by ThermalPilot. |
| `keyInfo.dataType` | `uint32_t` | FourCC data type such as `flt `, `ui8 `, `sp78`, `fpe2`. |
| `keyInfo.dataAttributes` | `uint8_t` | SMC metadata. The bit layout is private and must be logged raw. |
| `result` | `uint8_t` | SMC command result. Non-zero is failure. |
| `status` | `uint8_t` | SMC status. Log raw when debugging. |
| `data8` | `uint8_t` | Command selector. |
| `data32` | `uint32_t` | Index for `READ_INDEX`; command-specific otherwise. |
| `bytes` | `uint8_t[32]` | Value bytes. |

## Data Type Decoding

ThermalPilot must keep raw bytes available for every decoded value. SMC type
semantics are partly model-specific.

| Type | Decoder | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `flt ` | IEEE 754 single-precision, little-endian on local M4 Max | Current M4 Max evidence: `F0Mn raw=0x00C0A844` decodes to `1350`. |
| `fpe2` | unsigned fixed-point, big-endian, divided by 4 | Common legacy RPM encoding. |
| `sp78` | signed 7.8 fixed-point, big-endian | Common legacy temperature encoding. |
| `ui8 ` / `ui8` | unsigned 8-bit integer | Used by `FNum`, `F0Md`, `Ftst`. |
| `ui16` | unsigned 16-bit integer, big-endian | Used by some status/speed-like keys. |
| `ui32` | unsigned 32-bit integer, big-endian | Used by count-like keys on some systems. |
| `ch8*` | byte string | Log raw and printable ASCII when safe. |

If a numeric decoder produces `NaN`, infinity, or an implausible value for a
sensor class, ThermalPilot must display raw bytes and exclude the value from
control decisions.

## Observed Registers On Mac16,5 / M4 Max

Observed by running:

```sh
.build/release/thermalpilot FNum F0Ac F0Mn F0Mx F0Tg F1Ac F1Mn F1Mx F1Tg F0Md F1Md 'FS! ' Ftst RPlt
```

Results on 2026-06-27:

| Key | Type | Value | Raw | Control role |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `FNum` | `ui8 ` | `2` | `0x02` | Fan count. Read-only. |
| `F0Ac` | `flt ` | `0` | `0x00000000` | Fan 0 actual speed. Read-only. |
| `F0Mn` | `flt ` | `1350` | `0x00C0A844` | Fan 0 minimum. Clamp lower bound. |
| `F0Mx` | `flt ` | `5777` | `0x0088B445` | Fan 0 maximum. Clamp upper bound. |
| `F0Tg` | `flt ` | `0` | `0x00000000` | Fan 0 target. Potential future control register. |
| `F1Ac` | `flt ` | `0` | `0x00000000` | Fan 1 actual speed. Read-only. |
| `F1Mn` | `flt ` | `1350` | `0x00C0A844` | Fan 1 minimum. Clamp lower bound. |
| `F1Mx` | `flt ` | `5777` | `0x0088B445` | Fan 1 maximum. Clamp upper bound. |
| `F1Tg` | `flt ` | `0` | `0x00000000` | Fan 1 target. Potential future control register. |
| `F0Md` | `ui8 ` | `3` | `0x03` | Fan 0 mode. Semantics unverified; do not write yet. |
| `F1Md` | `ui8 ` | `3` | `0x03` | Fan 1 mode. Semantics unverified; do not write yet. |
| `Ftst` | `ui8 ` | `0` | `0x00` | Fan/test status. Semantics unverified; do not write. |
| `FS! ` | unavailable | unavailable | unavailable | Legacy forced-mode mask unavailable on this M4 Max. |
| `RPlt` | `ch8*` | `j616c` | `0x6A36313663000000` | Platform identifier. Read-only. |

This evidence means active fan control on this machine must not assume the
legacy `FS! ` mask exists. Any future controller needs a separate Apple Silicon
mode-register validation pass.

## Fan Control Registers And Bit Masks

### Legacy Forced-Mode Mask: `FS! `

Older AppleSMC tools and Linux drivers describe `FS!`/`FS! ` as a fan
manual/forced-mode mask. ThermalPilot treats this as a legacy convention, not
as a guaranteed Apple Silicon control register.

If present, the mask must be interpreted as a bitset:

| Bit | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| `1 << 0` | Fan 0 is in manual/forced mode. |
| `1 << 1` | Fan 1 is in manual/forced mode. |
| `1 << n` | Fan n is in manual/forced mode. |

Common values:

| Mask | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| `0x0000` | All fans automatic/system-controlled. |
| `0x0001` | Fan 0 manual/forced. |
| `0x0002` | Fan 1 manual/forced. |
| `0x0003` | Fan 0 and fan 1 manual/forced. |

Guardrail: even if this key exists, writes to it are forbidden until a
model-specific rollback test proves that writing `0x0000` reliably returns all
fans to automatic control.

### Per-Fan Target: `F{n}Tg`

`F0Tg`, `F1Tg`, and equivalent keys are target-speed registers in legacy
AppleSMC tooling. On the local M4 Max they read as `flt ` values and currently
return `0` while the system is idle with fans stopped.

Future writes to target registers must obey:

- target must be greater than or equal to discovered minimum RPM
- target must be less than or equal to discovered maximum RPM
- target must not be below current actual RPM when ThermalPilot is active
- target must be rounded to a conservative hardware-safe increment
- target must be time-limited by a control lease

### Per-Fan Mode: `F{n}Md`

`F0Md` and `F1Md` are present on the local M4 Max and read as `ui8 = 3`. This
likely reflects an Apple Silicon fan mode/state, but write semantics are not
verified.

ThermalPilot must not write `F{n}Md` until:

1. The meaning of each observed value is documented per model.
2. Automatic-mode value is known and tested.
3. Manual-mode value is known and tested.
4. A crash-safe rollback path is implemented.
5. The model is explicitly allowlisted.

### Test/Status Register: `Ftst`

`Ftst` is present on the local M4 Max and reads as `ui8 = 0`. Treat it as a
status/test register. It must remain read-only unless independent evidence
proves a safe use.

### Safe-Speed Registers: `F{n}Sf`

`F0Sf` and `F1Sf` read as `ui16 = 0` on the local M4 Max. Treat these as
read-only unknowns. Do not use them for control decisions until labeled.

## Predictive Control Design

### Inputs

The predictor consumes a rolling window of local observations:

- fan actual/min/max/target/mode
- selected temperature sensors
- selected power sensors
- `ProcessInfo.thermalState`
- CPU, GPU, and memory pressure when available
- AC versus battery state
- process-level workload hints
- MLX inference hints when available

MLX hints should eventually include:

- workload starting soon
- model identifier
- quantization or parameter class
- prompt/context size
- expected max output tokens
- concurrency or batch size
- current tokens per second
- expected duration band

### Risk Score

The first version should use a transparent rules model before ML:

```text
risk =
  heat_slope_score
  + sustained_power_score
  + fan_idle_or_lag_score
  + thermal_state_score
  + workload_intent_score
  + recent_throttle_or_pressure_score
```

Risk windows:

- `30s`: immediate fan response
- `60s`: normal pre-cool decision
- `180s`: MLX/inference planning window

Initial examples:

- If thermal state is `fair` and max selected temp is rising, pre-cool.
- If an MLX job is about to run for more than 60 seconds, pre-cool before
  launch even if current temperature is moderate.
- If fans are stopped and temperature slope is steep under sustained package
  power, pre-cool.
- If thermal state reaches `serious` or `critical`, stop prediction and enter
  failsafe behavior.

### Control States

| State | Writes allowed | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `observe` | no | Read telemetry and compute risk. |
| `advise` | no | Print or surface what ThermalPilot would do. |
| `preCoolLease` | yes, helper only | Temporarily raise fan target for a bounded window. |
| `release` | yes, helper only | Restore automatic/system mode. |
| `failsafe` | yes, helper only | Prefer system automatic control; if automatic restoration fails, drive fans high and alert. |

The first shipped intelligent mode should be `advise`. Active fan writes come
after the predictor has produced useful dry-run decisions.

## Active-Control Safeguards

### Global Defaults

- Read-only mode is default.
- Active control requires explicit user opt-in.
- Active control requires a privileged helper; the normal CLI/UI must not write
  SMC keys directly.
- Active control is disabled unless the Mac model is allowlisted.
- Active control is disabled unless all required registers are readable and
  validated.
- Active control is disabled if fan count, min RPM, or max RPM is unavailable.

### Write Isolation

All writes must live in one small helper module with a narrow API:

```text
requestPreCool(targets, leaseDuration, reason)
restoreAutomatic(reason)
emergencyRelease(reason)
```

The helper must not accept arbitrary SMC key writes from the UI, CLI, or MLX
integration.

### Lease-Based Control

Every active fan request is a lease:

- default lease: 30 seconds
- maximum single lease: 120 seconds
- renewal requires fresh telemetry and a still-valid risk score
- expired lease restores automatic control
- missed heartbeat restores automatic control

### Fan Target Clamps

For fan `n`:

```text
minRPM = read(F{n}Mn)
maxRPM = read(F{n}Mx)
currentRPM = read(F{n}Ac)
targetRPM = requested pre-cool target

effectiveTarget =
  clamp(targetRPM, minRPM, maxRPM)
```

Additional constraints:

- never request below `minRPM`
- never request below `currentRPM` while ThermalPilot holds a lease
- never exceed `maxRPM`
- do not change target more often than once every 5 seconds
- avoid target jumps larger than 500 RPM unless entering failsafe
- prefer symmetric targets for dual-fan systems until per-fan thermal zones are
  mapped

Initial target bands:

| Band | Formula |
| --- | --- |
| quiet pre-cool | `minRPM + 0.20 * (maxRPM - minRPM)` |
| normal pre-cool | `minRPM + 0.35 * (maxRPM - minRPM)` |
| aggressive pre-cool | `minRPM + 0.60 * (maxRPM - minRPM)` |
| failsafe high | `minRPM + 0.85 * (maxRPM - minRPM)` or restore automatic |

For the observed M4 Max range `1350-5777`, normal pre-cool is approximately
`2900 RPM`.

### Automatic Restoration

ThermalPilot must restore automatic/system control on:

- normal exit
- SIGINT
- SIGTERM
- crash detected by helper heartbeat expiry
- sleep
- wake
- user logout
- helper restart
- thermal state `serious`
- thermal state `critical`
- unreadable fan telemetry
- failed write
- model mismatch after OS update

If the known automatic-mode register is unavailable or unverified, active
control must remain disabled.

### Thermal Emergency Rule

When `ProcessInfo.thermalState` becomes `serious` or `critical`, ThermalPilot
must stop trying to be predictive.

The emergency policy is:

1. Restore automatic/system control if the automatic rollback path is verified.
2. If rollback fails and a high-fan target path is verified, set a high bounded
   target and alert.
3. If neither path is verified, stop writing and alert loudly.

ThermalPilot must never hold a quiet or moderate manual target during a thermal
emergency.

### Audit Log

Every future write decision must log:

- timestamp
- model identifier
- platform identifier
- fan count
- min/max/current RPM
- selected temperatures
- selected power readings
- thermal state
- requested target
- clamped target
- lease duration
- reason code
- SMC registers written
- raw bytes before and after
- rollback result

Logs must avoid capturing prompts, file paths, or user content from MLX
workloads. Workload metadata should be coarse unless the user opts in.

### Model Allowlist

Active control requires a per-model capability file:

```yaml
model: Mac16,5
platform: j616c
fan_count: 2
value_encoding:
  flt: little_endian
fan_keys:
  actual: "F{n}Ac"
  minimum: "F{n}Mn"
  maximum: "F{n}Mx"
  target: "F{n}Tg"
  mode: "F{n}Md"
automatic_restore:
  verified: false
active_control:
  enabled: false
```

The initial `Mac16,5` entry must keep `active_control.enabled: false` until the
write and rollback path is verified.

## MLX Integration Contract

ThermalPilot should not require MLX to use the telemetry and predictor. MLX
integration is an optional workload-intent source.

Minimum local API:

```text
thermalpilot workload begin --kind mlx --expected-duration 300 --intensity high
thermalpilot workload end --id <id>
```

Future Swift API:

```swift
let lease = ThermalPilot.shared.beginWorkload(
    kind: .mlxInference,
    expectedDuration: .seconds(300),
    intensity: .high
)
defer { lease.end() }
```

The predictor may pre-cool when a workload begins. It must not inspect prompt
text or model inputs.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Better Read-Only Telemetry

- Improve sensor labeling.
- Persist bounded local time-series windows.
- Add JSON output.
- Add explicit raw mode for all key reads.
- Add model capability snapshot generation.

### Phase 1: Advisor Mode

- Run predictor in dry-run mode.
- Print decisions such as `would_pre_cool normal 2900rpm for 60s`.
- Compare predictions against later thermal state and temperature curves.
- Tune thresholds without any fan writes.
- Compare advisor decisions against ThermalForge Smart and MTPLX Smart fan
  behavior on the same workloads.

### Phase 2: Privileged Helper Skeleton

- Decide whether the first active backend should be ThermalForge interop or a
  native helper. Prefer ThermalForge interop unless a concrete limitation
  requires native writes.
- Add helper process with no active write support by default if native control
  is still justified.
- Add lease, heartbeat, and rollback machinery.
- Add simulated SMC backend for safety tests.
- Keep real writes behind compile-time and runtime gates.

### Phase 3: Model-Specific Control Validation

- Validate automatic restore semantics on one allowlisted model.
- Validate target write semantics.
- Validate sleep/wake and crash rollback.
- Publish raw validation notes.

### Phase 4: Opt-In Active Pre-Cool

- Enable pre-cool leases for allowlisted models only.
- Ship `--dry-run` as default for new users.
- Require explicit command or settings confirmation for active mode.

## Verification Requirements

Before active control ships:

- Unit tests for all value decoders.
- Unit tests for fan mask encode/decode.
- Unit tests for target clamp math.
- Unit tests for lease expiry.
- Unit tests for rollback on simulated failures.
- Integration tests against a fake SMC backend.
- Static check that the read-only target does not link write symbols.
- Manual hardware validation with raw before/after SMC key logs.
- Sleep/wake validation.
- Crash validation.
- Thermal emergency validation.

## Source Notes

The SMC command numbers and key conventions are private AppleSMC conventions
documented by open source tools and drivers, not by Apple as a public fan
control API. ThermalPilot should preserve source links in code comments where
private conventions are encoded.
